            <p>
                King Pin Donuts is a family owned and operated business open since the 1930's. We use fine ingredients and traditional methods to produce exceptional donuts, cakes, muffins, pastries and cookies. We have been a pioneer in the baking industry being the
                first to offer trans-fat free products in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we continually strive for innovation at King Pin Donuts, we're still making our creations the way Dari (the new owner since 1980) intended to feed his young kids: high quality and fresh daily. We are proud and honored provide to our customers.
